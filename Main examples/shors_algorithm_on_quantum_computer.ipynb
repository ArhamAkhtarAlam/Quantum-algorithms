Its significance lies in its ability to factor large integers exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm, threatening the security of widely used cryptographic systems like RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. By efficiently solving this problem on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer, Shor's algorithm could revolutionize fields such as cryptography, cybersecurity, and computational mathematics, underscoring the transformative power of quantum computation.\n",

        "The seminal work [\\[3\\]](#references) from IBM® demonstrated Shor's algorithm for the first time, factoring the number 15 into its prime factors 3 and 5 using a seven-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum computer. Another experiment [\\[4\\]](#references) factored 15 using photonic qubits. By employing a single qubit recycled multiple times and encoding the work register in higher-dimensional states, the researchers reduced the required number of qubits to one-third of that in the standard protocol, utilizing a two-photon compiled algorithm. A significant paper in the demonstration of Shor's algorithm is [\\[5\\]](#references), which uses Kitaev's iterative phase estimation [\\[8\\]](#references) technique to reduce the qubit requirement of the algorithm. Authors used seven control qubits and four cache qubits, together with the implementation of modular multipliers. This implementation, however, requires mid-circuit measurements with feed-forward operations and qubit recycling with reset operations. This demonstration was done on an ion-trap quantum computer.\n",
        "\n",
        "More recent work [\\[6\\]](#references) focused on factoring 15, 21, and 35 on IBM Quantum® hardware. Similar to previous work, researchers used a compiled version of the algorithm that employed a semi-classical quantum Fourier transform as proposed by Kitaev to minimize the number of physical qubits and gates. A most recent work [\\[7\\]](#references) also performed a proof-of-concept demonstration for factoring the integer 21. This demonstration also involved the use of a compiled version of the quantum phase estimation routine, and built upon the previous demonstration by [\\[4\\]](#references). Authors went beyond this work by using a configuration of approximate Toffoli gates with residual phase shifts. The algorithm was implemented on IBM quantum processors using only five qubits, and the presence of entanglement between the control and register qubits was verified successfully.\n",

        "We note that RSA encryption typically involves key sizes on the order of 2048 to 4096 bits. Attempting to factor a 2048-bit number with Shor's algorithm will result in a quantum circuit with millions of qubits, including the error correction overhead and a circuit depth on the order of a billion, which is beyond the limits of current quantum hardware to execute. Therefore, Shor's algorithm will require either optimized circuit construction methods or robust quantum error correction to be practically viable for breaking modern cryptographic systems. We refer you to [\\[9\\]](#references) for a more detailed discussion on resource estimation for Shor's algorithm.\n",
